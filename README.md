# Spreadsheet Project
My contributions to a spreadsheet application project. The spreadsheet has an underlying graph structure in which nodes are instances of the Cell class. To determine whether the current directed graph is acyclic, I implemented the topological sort algorithm in the method isCyclic() in the Spreadsheet class.
